Prompt 
"Prepare a comprehensive comparative report on how different Generative AI platforms, specifically 
ChatGPT and Perplexity AI, function. The report should explain their underlying Large Language 
Model (LLM) architectures, data sources, response generation methods, accuracy, and relevance in 
answering queries. Include differences in user interaction styles, fact-checking abilities, and 
integration features. Present the content in a professional report format with sections covering 
introduction, working principles, applications, strengths, limitations, and a conclusion comparing 
their effectiveness." 
Aim 
To develop a comprehensive report on the fundamentals of Generative AI and Large Language 
Models (LLMs) with a focus on how different AI systems such as ChatGPT and Perplexity AI work, 
their architectures, data handling, and answer relevance. 
Experiment 
Study and compare the working mechanisms of ChatGPT and Perplexity AI to understand: 
1. Foundational concepts of Generative AI. 
2. Generative AI architectures (like transformers) used in these tools. 
3. Applications and strengths of each tool. 
4. Impact of LLM scaling on answer quality and relevance. 
Abstract 
This report explores the fundamentals of Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) through a 
practical comparison of ChatGPT and Perplexity AI. While both use transformer-based architectures, 
their data sourcing, retrieval methods, and answer styles differ significantly. ChatGPT excels in 
conversational depth and creativity, whereas Perplexity AI focuses on factual accuracy and real-time 
information retrieval with citations. The impact of scaling LLMs on both tools is also discussed.

1. Introduction to Generative AI 
Generative AI refers to systems that can produce new content — text, images, audio — by learning 
from massive datasets. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 use deep learning and transformer 
architectures to understand context, generate coherent responses, and adapt to different tasks. 
2. ChatGPT: Overview & Working 
• Developer: OpenAI 
• Architecture: GPT-3.5, GPT-4 — Transformer-based LLMs. 
• Knowledge Source: Pretrained on large text corpora (books, articles, web data) + optional 
web browsing for live info. 
• Working Mechanism: 
1. User inputs prompt. 
2. Model tokenizes input, processes it through multiple attention layers. 
3. Generates probable next tokens until completion. 
• Strengths: 
o Highly conversational. 
o Excellent for creative writing, coding, explanations. 
• Limitations: 
o Without browsing, info can be outdated. 
o No default citations. 
3. Perplexity AI: Overview & Working 
• Developer: Perplexity.ai 
• Architecture: Combines LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4) with real-time web search. 
• Knowledge Source: Live search results + pre-trained model knowledge. 
• Working Mechanism: 
1. User inputs question. 
2. Perplexity sends the query to the web, retrieves top results. 
3. Summarizes and cites sources in real time. 
• Strengths: 
o Always updated with latest info. 
o Provides clickable citations. 
• Limitations: 
o Less creative in storytelling or ideation. 
o Quality depends on search results.

6. Impact of Scaling in LLMs 
Both ChatGPT and Perplexity benefit from scaling laws — larger models improve coherence, 
reasoning, and multi-language capabilities. 
• ChatGPT Scaling: GPT-2 → GPT-3 → GPT-4 improved context handling and reasoning. 
• Perplexity Scaling: Gains from LLM upgrades but also benefits from search algorithms and 
retrieval accuracy, meaning it’s less dependent solely on model size. 
7. Limitations & Ethical Considerations 
• ChatGPT: Risk of outdated info without browsing; hallucinations. 
• Perplexity AI: May surface unreliable sources; less suited for creative tasks. 
• Shared Risks: Bias in training data, misinformation potential, privacy concerns. 
8. Conclusion 
Both ChatGPT and Perplexity AI are advanced generative AI tools but excel in different areas: 
• For conceptual understanding & creativity → ChatGPT 
• For factual accuracy & up-to-date answers → Perplexity AI 
The choice depends on whether depth or timeliness matters more for the task.
